## [Optimal substructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_substructure)

* In computer science, a problem is said to have optimal substructure if an optimal solution can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems.

* This property is used to determine the usefulness of dynamic programming and greedy algorithms for a problem.
